    <h3>Project</h3>
    <h5>Heart Disease Prediction</h5>
    <p>A machine learning and deep learning model was developed to predict heart disease. The model used a convolutional
        neural network (CNN) for deep learning and various machine learning algorithms (ML algorithms) like random forest,
        decision tree, KNN, etc. The results of the different algorithms were compared and visualized.
        </p>
        <h5>Food Delivery Database Management System</h5>
        <p>The Food Delivery Database Management System is a software application that uses Java Swing, phpMyAdmin, and
            SQL to manage a food delivery database. The system allows users to create, edit, and delete records in the database, as
            well as query the database for information. The system can be used by food delivery businesses to manage their
            customer data, order data, and inventory data.</p>
